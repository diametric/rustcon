rustcon acts as a middleware application for Rust RCON connections. It provides
the following features:

- The ability to define static and dynamic queues where all RCON data is streamed in real time to Redis.
- Basic operating statistics about the Rust server output to InfluxDB 1.8+
- Fault tolerance, maintains a persistent connection and retries during outages to RCON.

You can toggle the Redis middleware or the stats collection on or off depending on your requirements.

STATS

The stats collector will run arbitrary RCON commands, or watch for a regex pattern and pass the
output of those commands or patterns into the _INPUT variable of a Tengo script.
The script is responsible for parsing that output into usable stats.
